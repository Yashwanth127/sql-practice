SQL PRACTICE REPOSITORY

This repository contains my SQL practice while learning SQL from scratch.
I am practicing using an online SQL compiler and saving my daily work
as text files for revision.

DAY 1 – SQL BASICS
- Introduction to SQL
- Creating tables
- Inserting data into tables
- Displaying data using SELECT

DAY 2 – DATA RETRIEVAL
- Selecting specific columns
- Using WHERE clause
- AND / OR conditions
- Sorting data using ORDER BY
- Limiting records using LIMIT
- Updating records using UPDATE
- Deleting records using DELETE
- Counting records using COUNT
- Removing duplicates using DISTINCT

Screenshots of daily practice are added separately in repo...
